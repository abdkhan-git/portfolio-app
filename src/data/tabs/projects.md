### Some of the projects I've worked on so far

### ChatPDF - Currently In Progress

### [FutFever] (https://github.com/abdkhan-git/FutFeverShop) - Football Jersey E-commerce Website

FutFever is a mock e-commerce web application I built to showcase my skills in developing online shopping experiences. Utilizing React for the front-end UI and Strapi headless CMS on the back-end, I created a streamlined website prototype focused on the sale of soccer jerseys and gear. The project implements key e-commerce flows from product discovery to cart management to checkout, integrating payment processing via Stripe to demonstrate a complete end-to-end user journey.
